## Basic JSX

JSX stands for **J**ava**S**cript **X**ML. <br />
It's not mandatory to use with React but it's highly recommendable.

<Step>

```jsx
const element = <h1 className="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>;
```

```js
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { className: "greeting" },
  "Hello, world!"
);
```

</Step>

## Why JSX

- Provides separation of concerns instead of seperation of technologies
- Prevents from code injection
- Easy learn curve
- Easy to read / easy to maintain
